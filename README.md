Welcome to the AI Dev Days Hackathon
The AI Dev Days Hackathon is the follow-up event to AI Dev Days. If you enjoyed the sessions, demos, and deep dives, now is your chance to turn inspiration into real-world innovation. Transform your learnings from AI Dev Days into production-ready solutions using Microsoft Foundry, Microsoft Agent Framework, Azure MCP, GitHub Copilot Agent Mode, and more.

This is a 5-week global challenge for developers to build AI agents, agentic DevOps workflows, and intelligent applications using Microsoft's AI platform, GitHub, VS Code, and Azure services.

Build with the Purpose-Built AI Platform
Microsoft's AI platform gives developers an end-to-end toolchain for building real, production-ready AI systems. Use Microsoft's newest AI, agent, cloud, and developer technologies to build solutions that solve real-world problems across any industry.

Whether you're creating:

•        An AI agent using Microsoft Agent Framework

•        An Agentic DevOps workflow with GitHub Copilot Agent Mode

•        A multi-agent application powered by Model Router

•        A secure enterprise AI app using Microsoft Foundry

•        An agent-to-agent (A2A) or MCP-connected system using Azure MCP

•        A next-gen SRE workflow using Azure SRE Agent

This hackathon is your playground.
